# Rick & Morty Aggregator Service
**Author:** Dominik Papaj

## Description
This is a simple Go backend service that consumes the public [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/) and exposes two endpoints:

1. **`/search`** — searches for characters, locations, and episodes by name.
2. **`/top-pairs`** — returns character pairs that appeared together in the most episodes.

The server runs on port `8080`.
